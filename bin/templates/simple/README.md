## Micro template web application

This is a very basic web application using the Micro MVC framework. It is a customizable startup web application template that you can customize to suit your requirements. The following features are included:

  - [Velocity](http://micro-docs.simplegames.ca/views/engines.md#Velocity) for rendering the dynamic content. See how to use [FreeMarker](http://micro-docs.simplegames.ca/views/engines.md#Freemarker) if you wish.
  - [i18N](http://micro-docs.simplegames.ca/internationalization.md) localization support enabled
  - reusable web content/fragments; `partials` and `templates`
  - [routing](http://micro-docs.simplegames.ca/routing.md/) and [extensions](http://micro-docs.simplegames.ca/extensions.md/)
  - customizable web templates wrapping around errors 404 and 500
  - and more!

### To use it:

 - check if Micro is installed properly; see the [docs](http://micro-docs.simplegames.ca/), for more details.
 - quickly check if Micro was built and it can be used:
    `$ micro -v`; you should see something like this: `Micro x.y.z`
 - start this web application:
    `$ micro start` or
    `$ ./run.sh`

You can access this app at:

    `http://localhost:8080` or `http://0.0.0.0:8080`

### To stop the app

Simply press `CTRL-C` in the console where the application was started.

### Now It's Your Turn
Customize it and build the next most awesome web application using Micro!

Good luck,
